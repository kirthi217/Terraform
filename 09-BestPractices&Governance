9: Best Practices and Governance
1.Terraform Best Practices for Code Organization
   Well-organized code is easier to understand, reuse, and maintain.

Best practices include:
    - Using modules
    - Keeping environments separate (dev, staging, prod)
    - Naming conventions for resources and variables
    - Avoiding hard-coded values
Why it matters:
    - Easier collaboration
    - Reduced technical debt
    - Faster onboarding for new team members
2.Security Considerations and Managing Secrets
   Infrastructure often requires sensitive data such as passwords and API keys.
Key principles:
    - Never store secrets in plain text
    - Use secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
    - Use environment variables
Security must be built into infrastructure from day one.

3.Infrastructure as Code Policies : Policies define what is allowed and what is not in infrastructure.
Examples:
    - No unencrypted storage
    - No public IPs on production servers
    - Mandatory tagging of resources
Tools may encounter:
    Sentinel
    Open Policy Agent (OPA)
4.Compliance and Governance Practices
   Governance ensures infrastructure aligns with company rules and legal requirements.
Covered concepts:
    - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - Approval workflows
    - Auditing and logging changes
Module 10: Collaboration and Automation
This module teaches how Terraform is used in real-world team environments, focusing on automation and collaboration.

1.Integrating Terraform with CI/CD Pipelines
   Terraform is often executed automatically through CI/CD pipelines.
    - Running terraform plan and apply in pipelines
    - Validating code before merging
    - Automating deployments
Common CI/CD tools:
GitHub Actions
GitLab CI
Jenkins
2. Using Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise
   Terraform Cloud and Enterprise help teams collaborate safely.
   Key features:
        Remote state management
        Policy enforcement
        Role-based access
        Run history and auditing
3.Implementing Automated Workflows and Pipelines
      Automation ensures consistency and speed.
Examples:
   Auto-deploy on merge
    Automatic rollback on failure
    Environment promotion (dev → prod)
4.Collaborating Effectively in Large Teams
      Terraform enables collaboration across large teams.
      Best practices:
   Use version control (Git)
    Code reviews
    Shared modules
    Clear ownership and documentation
